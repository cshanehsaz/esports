Todo:

- merge data by game web address


Potential Questions:
- how much can we predict about the outcome of a league game either before it starts or before 10 min
- USE GOLD DIFF AT 10 AS OUTCOME VARIABLE
    - give each pro player in lane an elo rating, use that and champ factors to give              expected golddiff in lane at 10 min then use that to predict team win rate
    - allows us to rank players and teams


Causal:

- can we determine the meta from analysis and ways to beat it
- which role is most important (by year)
- best item
- best champs
- best builds
- analyze strategies of best teams
- relative impact of a player based on their champ and team (basically expected runs)
- categorize players by playstyle (aggro, defensive, etc) find way to split and determine

Prediction:
- player ranking system
